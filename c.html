 Ingredients <br>
- 2 cups heavy cream<br>
- 1 cup whole milk<br>
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br>
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
- 4 large egg yolks<br>
  1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
1/2 cup chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (optional)<br>
<br><br>
Equipment<br>
- Medium saucepan<br>
- Whisk<br>
- Mixing bowls<br>
- Fine-mesh sieve<br>
- Ice cream maker<br>
- Storage container<br>
<br><br>
 Instructions
<br>
1. **Prepare the Base**<br>
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, and sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is warm and the sugar has dissolved (do not let it boil).
<br><br>
2. **Mix the Cocoa**
   - Whisk in the unsweetened cocoa powder until completely dissolved and smooth.
<br><br>
3. **Temper the Egg Yolks**
   - In a separate mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they are smooth. Gradually add a small amount of the warm chocolate mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly to temper the yolks. This helps prevent the eggs from scrambling.
<br><br>
4. **Combine and Cook**
   - Slowly pour the tempered yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining chocolate mixture, whisking constantly. Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon (about 170°F or 77°C).
<br><br>
5. **Strain and Cool**
   - Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any bits of cooked egg. Stir in the vanilla extract. Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
<br><br>
6. Churn the Ice Cream
   - Once the mixture is thoroughly chilled, pour it into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. This typically takes about 20-25 minutes.
<br><br>
7. **Add Chocolate Chips (Optional)**
   - If you want to add chocolate chips or chopped chocolate, add them in the last 5 minutes of churning.
<br><br>
8. **Freeze Until Firm**
   - Transfer the churned ice cream to a storage container. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent ice crystals from forming. Cover with a lid and freeze for at least 2 hours, or until firm.
<br><br><br>
Serving
- Scoop and serve your homemade chocolate ice cream. Enjoy!
<br><br>
This basic method ensures a rich, creamy chocolate ice cream with a deep cocoa flavor. Adjust the sweetness and chocolate intensity to your preference by experimenting with the amount of sugar and cocoa powder.
